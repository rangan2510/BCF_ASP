Aim of this organization is to provide information, consultation from the eminent oncologists from India, provide them treatment at minimal cost and help them in rehabilitation. There is a scope for screening, counseling of patients and attendants, help in supportive care, hospice care and also rehabilitation of families. However, the main thrust of this Organization is to provide appropriate standard ‘curative’ treatment at low cost for cancer patients and rehabilitation.

            There is a huge deficit in cancer treatment facility in Eastern India. Hence, a large number of cancer patients from Eastern India and neighboring country of Bangladesh regularly visit either Mumbai or Chennai for treatment and advice. It is extremely difficult for them to stay far from their native place for many months for treatment. There is a need for a treatment facility at their native place. This Organization is mostly for support these patients who had consultation and opinion at other places and want to continue treatment close to their native place; and also able to be in touch with the primary consultant at Chennai or Mumbai. Another group of patients are those who are not able to get opinion from eminent oncologists from different parts of the country but will be able to avail consultation and treatment at low cost. The objectives to initiate cancer screening, personalized medicine evaluation; counseling and rehabilitation care at the facility.

                    I have my graduation & post-graduation training from Kolkata. Hence, I know the facility, issues with treating the cancer patients and patient's perspective regarding treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, I have received training at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai and used to see large number of cancer patients from Bengal, Assam and Bangladesh. As a Bengali, these patients used the share their issues about staying away from their native place for long. There were issues about the 'man power', support, financial issues and problem with their profession while they are in Mumbai for treatment of their kins. At the same time, it is assumed that many patients need to come out of their state for diagnosis and specialized treatments. It will be fantastic if we have a support system in West Bengal where patients will get all possible support in between treatment, follow up and rehabilitation. Palliative care support systems need to be established at their native place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My wife, army nursing official (Lt Col) Mousumi Dutta and myself initially thought of Bengal Cancer Foundation as a support system for these patients. Then we welcomed educationist Dr Rita Bhattacharya (Rahaman), architect Rudranarayan Dutta, social worker Curtis Arathoon to be part of trustee and take the social cause forward.

                    We are providing services since Feb 2013 from a small office space at Moulali. Last year we have shifted to more equipped place near Moulali. We have every Friday palliative care clinic through EPIC and Dr Sankha Suvra Mitra, Medical Oncologist. There is rehabilitation services through Tribica group and Dr Tuhin Sinha. Every Saturday is free cancer consultation clinic by eminent consultants from Apollo Cancer Hospital, Chennai. There is regular clinic through physicians, surgeons and oncologists. 'Health check' and cancer screening is our major thrust and we have started low cost screening facility. We do have future plan for expansion and provide full fledged cancer care services at affordable cost.  We need your support and encouragement to fulfill our vision.
