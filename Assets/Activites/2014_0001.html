    <h3>Regular activities of Bengal Cancer Foundation</h3>

    <p>
        Cancer being the second leading cause of death globally has no antecedents for its eradication/control. Bengal Cancer Foundation has undertaken this stupendous task through its sharply defined objectives. Also establishing a Day Care Centre for Cancer Patient at Kolkata is on the cards. Also, Cancer Awareness Programs are held regularly by Social Works every month in West Bengal and Bangladesh.
