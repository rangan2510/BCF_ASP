    <h4>
      WORLD CANCER DAY EVENT, 4th FEB 2016
    </h4>
    <p>
      Just as cancer affects everyone in different ways, all people have the power to take various actions to reduce the
      impact that cancer has on individuals, families and communities. World Cancer Day is a chance to reflect on what
      you
      can do, make a pledge and take action. Whatever you choose to do make a difference to the fight against cancer.
      Every year on world cancer day an event is organized with the help of cancer survivors, our volunteers and
      supporters to celebrate survivorship and create more awareness. This year too we had organized an event that
      received a footfall of more than five hundred people including our present members and local people. Six fifty
      (650)
      people from one hundred and eighty families and individuals registered on the day to join hands and fight against
      cancer. Eminent artistes who have accomplished great heights in their own fields also supported us on the event
      and
      became our members.
      Wasim Kapoor, famous painter inaugurated the event with a painting which he later declared will be auctioned as a
      contribution to BCF fund. Musical meditation was staged that helps to bring down psychological stress and tension
      and healing of the soul. Sarod Baba (Avijit Ghosh) and Gayaki Mata (Piyali Maitra) who together performed the
      musical. A drama – Panchlight performed by Rangashilpi, also our supporter, got huge praise from the audience
      being
      a comic satire to the present state of affairs in a backward rural village where even a street light is thought to
      be a big step towards upliftment. A recitation by one of our survivors was also put up. Swati Ghoshal, a cancer
      survivor herself joined us and performed a recitation of Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore’s poetry helps people in all
      phases of life. Dr Debnarayan Dutta also interacted with the audience as well as our patients in midst of the
      program. Questionnaires were distributed to all those who attended to analyse the awareness quotient among common
      people. We are still working on the aspect of general knowledge of the people regarding cancer and its treatment.
      On the same day a talk show on cancer awareness was conducted with an interactive phone call session aired on
      Doordarshan for the same motive. Dr Sarah Price and our patient Anuradha Addhya accompanied Dr. Dutta to the show
      which helped us to generate mass awareness and we received some donation to our foundation too. Mrs. Basanti Devi
      who is an aged lady after watching the program on television contacted us for voluntary service and donation to
      our
      foundation.
